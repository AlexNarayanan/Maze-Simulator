Maze Generation and Search

Authors: Alex Narayanan and Rui Zheng

========

Play with simulation here: http://alexnarayanan.github.io/MazeGame/

Generate mazes with Kruskal's Algorithm, and auto-solve with depth first and breadth first search.

Created for Final Project for CS 2510 Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 at Northeastern University.

Uses tester and javalib libraries for testing and execution of a world program. 

USER GUIDE

Java Applet run from MazeGameApplet class.
Java application can be run from either Examples clsas or MazeGame class, bigbangs have to be uncommented

CONTROLS:
space           show the minimal spanning tree of the current maze
d               start a new depth-first search
b               start a new breadth-first search
n               create a new maze of the same size
up              create a new maze of bigger size (up to a cap of size 35)
down            create a new maze of smaller size (up to a cap of size 5)
